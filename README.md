## Speech Emotion Recognition

Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a project that aims to classify the emotional content of spoken language. This project utilizes machine learning and natural language processing techniques to analyze and categorize emotions expressed in audio recordings. By accurately identifying emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more in spoken language, SER has a wide range of applications, including sentiment analysis, customer feedback analysis, and human-computer interaction improvement.
